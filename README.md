**other experience 😋**
with my TikTok (listed below), i began engaging in the community of linux on the platform and gained the name Linuxlarper, for those who dont know, a larp in cybersec is someone who takes their job or their purpose wayyyy too seriously, and is generally annoying about it (my definition of it),
overall, I've gained around 50k+ likes and 400k+ views from just posting larping and a **bit of** political content, i just generally make fun of other distros and users of said distros

**my distro progession**
- i started out on ZorinOS with a crappy laptop, learned a bit of skills and how to use the terminal
- then i began using linux on severs in the cloud and learning a lot of networking, devops and skills from there
- next, got a raspberry pi and really got into homelabbing and selfhosting with running programs, discord bots and more using docker, systemd and python on the debian platform for linux
- then i fully made the switch to linux from windows being my daily drive, i started out with Pop!_OS, then went to Fedora COSMIC, Fedora KDE and now CachyOS KDE
- and im currently daily driving CachyOS, and i use debian o my homelab

in basic sequence: Windows -> Linux on the Server -> Raspberry Pi -> Pop!_OS -> Fedora Linux (KDE Plasma/COSMIC DE) -> CachyOS (KDE Plasma)
